The functionality is not quite what I was envisioning.

 I was hoping to make it voice friendly.

  it's very difficult to select items in the tree view using voice commands.

   is it possible to filter the actual lines in the document itself?

    also there are buttons at the top of the list items that are hidden by default.

    somebody like me using voice recognition would never even know they were there unless they accidentally left their mouse over them.  there are lots of buttons like this I have never even found after years of using the program.

    the keyboard shortcut ctrl+f  clashes with the document search function.
